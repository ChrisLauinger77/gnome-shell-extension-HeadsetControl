# Building HeadsetControl

Follow the instructions at https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl/ for building the binary and note down the path to it.

You can test the helper application manually via headsetcontrol -b, this should print the current battery level to the console if your headset is supported.

Make sure you have gnome-icon-theme package installed.

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome.

To update the translation files run
`./headsetcontrol.sh translate` in the extensions directory after your code changes are finished. This will update the files in po folder.
Then poedit (https://poedit.net/download) can be used to translate the strings. poedit can also be used to create new localization files.

# Debugging

Logging can be enabled in settings.
Afterwards open a console and type:

journalctl -f -o cat

You will see now the output in the console when you try to show the quicksettings.

Fedora has a package for "headsetcontrol" which seems to be outdated.
(see [#14](https://github.com/ChrisLauinger77/gnome-shell-extension-HeadsetControl/issues/14))

Using the github version until Fedora updates the package is recommended.
